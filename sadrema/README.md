# jMetal 5 Development Site

## Purpose

**jMetal** is an object-oriented Java-based framework for multi-objective optimization with metaheuristics.
The Web page of the project is: [http://jmetal.github.io/jMetal/](http://jmetal.github.io/jMetal/).
Former jMetal versions can be found in [SourceForge](http://jmetal.sourceforge.net). The current version is jMetal 5.6. 

## How to use

You can find the last released versions of jMetal on the [Maven Central Repository](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.uma.jmetal).

To use jMetal in your project, you need at least the `jmetal-core` artifact.
It provides various components used to implement jMetal algorithms.
To implement your own, you only need this package.

jMetal comes with various algorithms already implemented, which you can obtain by adding the `jmetal-algorithm` artifact.
If you are more interested in experimenting with your own algorithms, you can instead add the `jmetal-problem` artifact to obtain various problems to solve.
You can of course add both of them to try combinations.
If you want to go further by running and evaluating different combinations, you can finally add the `jmetal-exec` artifact, which comes with various utilities.

## Status

The jMetal development version is hosted in this repository; this way, interested users can take a look to the new incoming features in advance.

If you are interested in contributing with your ideas and comments, please take a look at the current discussions in the [Issues section](https://github.com/jMetal/jMetal/issues).

## Changelog of the next incoming release (jMetal 5.7)
### Algorithms
* [mIBEA](https://github.com/jMetal/jMetal/blob/master/jmetal-algorithm/src/main/java/org/uma/jmetal/algorithm/multiobjective/ibea/mIBEA). Variant of IBEA contributed buy @vinixnan.
* [d-NSGA-II](https://github.com/jMetal/jMetal/blob/master/jmetal-algorithm/src/main/java/org/uma/jmetal/algorithm/multiobjective/nsgaii/DNSGAII.java). Algorithm D-NSGA-II contributed by @dynamic-sevn

### Features
* When the quality indicators of an experiment are computed, a summary file called `QualityIndicatorSummary.csv` is generated. This is a CSV file containing the following fields: `Algorithm`, `Problem`, `IndicatorName`, `ExecutionId`, `IndicatorValue`.
* Added the [DynamicDoubleProblem](https://github.com/jMetal/jMetal/blob/master/jmetal-core/src/main/java/org/uma/jmetal/problem/impl/DynamicDoubleProblem.java) class, which allows to define a double problem dynamically.
* Class [ConstrainedProblem](https://github.com/jMetal/jMetal/blob/master/jmetal-core/src/main/java/org/uma/jmetal/problem/ConstrainedProblem.java) is deprecated, and all the problems depending on it have been refactored. 
* A method `getVariables()` has been added to class [`Solution`](https://github.com/jMetal/jMetal/blob/master/jmetal-core/src/main/java/org/uma/jmetal/solution/Solution.java).
* The [NSGAII](https://github.com/jMetal/jMetal/blob/master/jmetal-algorithm/src/main/java/org/uma/jmetal/algorithm/multiobjective/nsgaii/NSGAII.java) class has been refactored to allow to indicate the size of the mating pool and the offspring population. This allows, for example, to configure a state version of it by assigning the values `matingPoolSize = 2` and `offspringPopulationSize = 1`, so classes such as [SteadyStateNSGAII](https://github.com/jMetal/jMetal/blob/master/jmetal-algorithm/src/main/java/org/uma/jmetal/algorithm/multiobjective/nsgaii/SteadyStateNSGAII.java) are not necessary. All the classes related to NSGA-II have been refactored as a consequence.

### Bugs
* Fixed a bug in class [EnviromentalSelection](https://github.com/jMetal/jMetal/blob/master/jmetal-algorithm/src/main/java/org/uma/jmetal/algorithm/multiobjective/spea2/util/EnvironmentalSelection.java). Thanks to @zorrozork
